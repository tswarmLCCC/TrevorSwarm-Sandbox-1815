# Unit 7 Asynchronous Study Guide: Schema Design, DDL & Integrity

**Estimated Preparation Time:** 150 Minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Units 1–6 (Foundations, Selection, Joins, Aggregation, Safe DML, CTEs)  
**Target Competencies:** Relational Normalization (1NF–3NF), DDL Scripting, Integrity Constraints (`PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `CHECK`, `UNIQUE`), Views

---

## 1. Overview & Learning Objectives
Welcome to Unit 7! In this unit, you transition from querying databases to designing and engineering relational database schemas. You will learn the theoretical principles of normalization to eliminate data redundancy and anomalies, implement table structures using PostgreSQL Data Definition Language (DDL), enforce enterprise business rules using declarative constraints, and create Views for data security and simplified reporting.

By the end of this study guide, you will be able to:
1. Identify insertion, update, and deletion anomalies in flat, unnormalized files.
2. Decompose denormalized data step-by-step into First (1NF), Second (2NF), and Third Normal Form (3NF).
3. Write clean, production-ready DDL scripts (`CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`).
4. Enforce referential integrity using Foreign Keys and configure referential actions (`RESTRICT`, `CASCADE`, `SET NULL`).
5. Enforce domain integrity using `CHECK`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`, and `DEFAULT` constraints.
6. Create virtual tables using `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` for security masking and reporting encapsulation.

## 4. Key Architectural Mental Models

### A. The Three Normal Forms
```
Unnormalized Flat File: Contains multivalued lists and repeated data groups.
           |
       [ 1NF ] --> Atomic values only. No comma-separated lists. Every cell is indivisible.
           |
       [ 2NF ] --> In 1NF + No partial dependencies on composite primary keys.
           |
       [ 3NF ] --> In 2NF + No transitive dependencies (Non-key columns cannot depend on non-key columns).
```
**The Relational Mnemonic:** *"Every non-key attribute must depend on the Key, the Whole Key, and Nothing But the Key, so help me Codd!"*

### B. Foreign Key Referential Actions
* **`ON DELETE RESTRICT` (Default):** Rejects deletion of a parent row if child rows exist. Prevents orphaned records.
* **`ON DELETE CASCADE`:** Automatically deletes all dependent child rows when a parent row is deleted.
* **`ON DELETE SET NULL`:** Unlinks child rows by setting their foreign key column to `NULL`.

## 5. Summary Reference Cards

| Constraint / Clause | Purpose | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PRIMARY KEY` | Unique identifier; enforces NOT NULL | `id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` |
| `FOREIGN KEY` | Enforces referential integrity to parent | `REFERENCES customers(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT` |
| `CHECK (condition)` | Validates business rules at storage layer | `CHECK (salary >= 0.00)` |
| `UNIQUE` | Guarantees column values are distinct | `email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE` |
| `DEFAULT` | Auto-supplies value if omitted | `created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` |
| `CREATE VIEW` | Virtual table encapsulating a query | `CREATE VIEW v_active_users AS SELECT ...;` |

## Step 6: Learn with AI — Interactive Practice & Prompt Craft (100% Free Tools)

### Role & Persona: The Enterprise Data Modeler
* **Pedagogical Technique:** Normalization Breakdown (1NF–3NF) & Constraint Hardening
* **Core Goal:** Transform messy, unnormalized spreadsheet chaos into a clean Third Normal Form (3NF) relational model with bulletproof DDL constraints.
* **Recommended Free Tools:** ChatGPT Free, Claude Free, Google Gemini Free, Microsoft Copilot *(Zero subscription or paid API key required)*

#### Copy-and-Paste AI Prompt Template
```text
Act as a Senior Enterprise Data Modeler. I am learning Relational Database Design, Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF), and DDL constraint declaration in PostgreSQL 16.
Give me a messy, denormalized 10-column spreadsheet table from a hospital clinic or university containing repeating groups, multi-valued fields, partial key dependencies, and transitive dependencies.
Walk me through an interactive schema design challenge:
Step 1: Ask me to identify the 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF violations in the spreadsheet.
Step 2: Have me propose a normalized relational schema with entity tables, primary keys, and foreign keys.
Step 3: Have me write the complete PostgreSQL DDL (CREATE TABLE) statements with strict constraints (CHECK, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, ON DELETE CASCADE/SET NULL) and a reporting VIEW.
Critique my schema at each step. Do NOT write the DDL for me; guide me with design questions.
```

#### Step-by-Step Interactive Drill
1. Paste the prompt into your free AI tool.
2. Identify insertion, update, and deletion anomalies in the unnormalized spreadsheet.
3. Propose normalized 3NF entity tables with primary and foreign keys.
4. Write production DDL with constraints and create a reporting VIEW. Submit to the modeler for review.

#### Asynchronous Participation Deliverable
> **Canvas Discussion Prompt:**
> Post to the Unit 7 Discussion: (1) The denormalized spreadsheet sample, (2) Your 3NF entity-relationship breakdown, (3) Your production DDL script with constraints, and (4) Why your chosen ON DELETE referential action was the safest choice.
