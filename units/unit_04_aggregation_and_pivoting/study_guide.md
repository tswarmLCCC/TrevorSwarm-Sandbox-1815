## 1. Overview & Learning Objectives
Welcome to Unit 4! In this module, you transition from retrieving individual transactional records to generating high-level business metrics. In real-world data engineering and analytics, 90% of dashboard cards, KPIs, and executive reports rely on the aggregation concepts covered here.

By the end of this study guide, you will be able to:
1. Explain how aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`) collapse datasets.
2. Apply the **Golden Rule of `GROUP BY`** without encountering column grouping syntax errors.
3. Distinguish clearly between row-level filters (`WHERE`) and aggregated group-level filters (`HAVING`).
4. Combine independent query result sets vertically using `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`.
5. Pivot categorical data horizontally into cross-tabulated reporting columns using `CASE WHEN` inside aggregates.

## 3. Required Reading & Tutorials (PostgreSQLTutorial.com)
Complete the following modules on PostgreSQLTutorial.com:

1. [PostgreSQL Aggregate Functions Guide](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-aggregate-functions/)  
   *Focus on:* Why `COUNT(*)` counts physical rows while `COUNT(column)` ignores `NULL` entries.
2. [PostgreSQL GROUP BY Tutorial](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-group-by/)  
   *Focus on:* The syntax requirement that all unaggregated projected columns must appear in the `GROUP BY` list.
3. [PostgreSQL HAVING Clause](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-having/)  
   *Focus on:* The execution pipeline: `WHERE` runs before grouping; `HAVING` runs after grouping.
4. [PostgreSQL UNION & UNION ALL](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-union/)  
   *Focus on:* The performance cost of `UNION` (deduplication sort) vs. `UNION ALL`.
5. [PostgreSQL INTERSECT & EXCEPT](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-intersect/)  
   *Focus on:* Finding overlapping rows and isolating discrepancies between separate queries.

## 4. Key Architectural Mental Models

### A. The "Funnel" Concept
Every query up until Unit 4 returned rows in a 1-to-1 correspondence with the rows stored on disk. Aggregation acts as a **Funnel**:
```
  [ 5,000 Order Items ]
            |
  +---------v---------+
  |     GROUP BY      |  <-- Groups rows into unique categorical buckets
  |   product_line    |
  +---------+---------+
            |
  [ SUM, AVG, COUNT ]  <-- Evaluates metrics across each bucket
            |
  [ 4 Summary Rows ]   <-- Final executive report
```

### B. Logical Query Execution Pipeline
Always remember the order in which PostgreSQL processes your SQL statements:
```
1. FROM / JOIN     (Locates and links tables)
2. WHERE           (Filters individual raw rows)
3. GROUP BY        (Collapses surviving rows into summary buckets)
4. HAVING          (Filters summary buckets based on aggregate conditions)
5. SELECT          (Calculates final expressions, pivots, and aliases)
6. DISTINCT        (Deduplicates projected rows)
7. ORDER BY        (Sorts the final output)
8. LIMIT / OFFSET  (Paginates results)
```

## 5. Summary Reference Cards

| Clause / Operator | Purpose | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `COUNT(*)` | Counts all physical rows regardless of content | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;` |
| `COUNT(col)` | Counts non-null entries in `col` | `SELECT COUNT(ship_date) FROM orders;` |
| `GROUP BY` | Forms categorical summary buckets | `SELECT dept, AVG(salary) FROM emp GROUP BY dept;` |
| `HAVING` | Filters summary buckets after aggregation | `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5` |
| `UNION ALL` | Stacks queries vertically, preserving duplicates | `SELECT id FROM q1 UNION ALL SELECT id FROM q2;` |
| `CASE` Pivot | Rotates rows into horizontal metric columns | `SUM(CASE WHEN qtr='Q1' THEN rev ELSE 0 END)` |

## Step 6: Learn with AI — Interactive Practice & Prompt Craft (100% Free Tools)

### Role & Persona: The CFO Financial Reporting Coach
* **Pedagogical Technique:** Cross-Tab Pivoting & Division-by-Zero Defense
* **Core Goal:** Collaborate with an AI CFO to build executive dashboard queries featuring matrix pivoting (CASE WHEN inside SUM), group filtering (HAVING), and zero-division protection (NULLIF).
* **Recommended Free Tools:** ChatGPT Free, Claude Free, Google Gemini Free, Microsoft Copilot *(Zero subscription or paid API key required)*

#### Copy-and-Paste AI Prompt Template
```text
Act as a CFO and Lead Analytics Architect. I need to generate an executive quarterly financial report from our sales database using PostgreSQL 16.
Table: sales_transactions (transaction_id, region, department, quarter, revenue, discount_amount, refund_count)

Challenge me to write an advanced aggregation query that produces a single cross-tab pivot matrix showing:
1. Total revenue per region broken down into distinct columns for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 using conditional CASE aggregation.
2. The refund rate percentage (refund_count / total transactions), safely protected against division-by-zero using NULLIF.
3. A HAVING filter that excludes regions with fewer than 50 total sales.
Provide the requirements step-by-step. Review my SQL syntax, check for GROUP BY violations, and verify whether my matrix matches CFO dashboard standards.
```

#### Step-by-Step Interactive Drill
1. Paste the prompt into your free AI tool.
2. Write the conditional aggregation query using SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q1' THEN revenue ELSE 0 END).
3. Protect calculations against division-by-zero using NULLIF.
4. Apply the HAVING clause to filter grouped results. Iterate with the AI until the report meets CFO standards.

#### Asynchronous Participation Deliverable
> **Canvas Discussion Prompt:**
> Submit to the Unit 4 Discussion: (1) Your completed cross-tab SQL query, (2) An explanation of why CASE inside SUM eliminates the need for separate queries, and (3) How NULLIF saved your calculations from throwing a runtime division-by-zero exception.
